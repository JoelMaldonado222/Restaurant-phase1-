/**
 * Represents an individual employee within the restaurant management system.
 * This class encapsulates all employee-related data and business logic including
 * personal information, compensation details, and work schedule information.
 *
 * The Employee class enforces business rules such as:
 * - Name validation (letters and spaces only, cannot be empty)
 * - Non-negative hourly rates (prevents data entry errors)
 * - Realistic hours worked limits (0-168 hours per week maximum)
 * - Automatic weekly pay calculations based on rate and hours
 *
 * This class follows the principle of data encapsulation by keeping all fields
 * private and providing controlled access through getter and setter methods
 * with appropriate validation.
